# Inventory Management Implementation Summary

## Database Changes

### 1. Added quantity column to products table

Run the SQL script `database/add_quantity_column.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Step 1: Add quantity column to products table
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Step 2: Add check constraint for non-negative quantity
ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT check_quantity_non_negative CHECK (quantity >= 0);

-- Step 3: Update existing products to have default quantity of 10
UPDATE products SET quantity = 10 WHERE quantity = 0;

-- Step 4: Create index on quantity for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_products_quantity ON products(quantity);

-- Step 5: Create index on product_code for search performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_product_code ON products(product_code);

-- Step 6: Update is_available based on quantity
UPDATE products SET is_available = (quantity > 0);

-- Step 7: Create function to automatically update is_available when quantity changes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_product_availability()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.is_available = (NEW.quantity > 0);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Step 8: Create the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_update_product_availability ON products;
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_product_availability
    BEFORE UPDATE OF quantity ON products
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_product_availability();
```

### 2. Automatic availability management

- Products with `quantity > 0` are automatically set to `is_available = true`
- Products with `quantity = 0` are automatically set to `is_available = false`
- This is handled by a database trigger

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Inventory Management API (`/api/inventory`)

- **GET**: Fetch products with filtering by category, search term, and product code
- **PUT**: Update product quantity (automatically updates availability)
- Includes pagination support
- Only admins can access this endpoint

### 2. Admin Inventory Management Interface

- Located in Admin Dashboard → Inventory tab
- Features:
  - Filter by category (dropdown)
  - Search by product name/description
  - Search by product code
  - Real-time quantity updates
  - Visual indicators for stock status:
    - Green: In stock
    - Yellow: Low stock (< 5 items)
    - Red: Out of stock (0 items)
  - Pagination for large product catalogs

### 3. User-facing Product Display

- Only shows products with `quantity > 0` and `is_available = true`
- Displays current stock count on product cards
- Shows "Out of Stock" badge for unavailable products
- Prevents adding out-of-stock items to cart

### 4. Updated Admin Product Management

- Now displays quantity information in product cards
- Shows current stock level for each product

## How It Works

### For Admin Users:

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Inventory tab
2. Use filters to find specific products:
   - Select category from dropdown
   - Search by product name or description
   - Search by product code
3. Update quantity by changing the number in the quantity field
4. Changes are saved automatically
5. Product availability is updated based on quantity:
   - Quantity > 0: Product becomes available to users
   - Quantity = 0: Product becomes unavailable to users

### For Regular Users:

1. Browse products - only see items with stock > 0
2. View product details showing current stock level
3. Cannot purchase out-of-stock items
4. Products automatically disappear from listings when quantity reaches 0

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema:

- Added `quantity` column to `products` table
- Database trigger automatically manages `is_available` field
- Indexes added for performance on quantity and product_code searches

### API Updates:

- `/api/products` - Now filters out products with quantity = 0
- `/api/inventory` - New endpoint for inventory management
- `/api/admin/products` - Updated to include quantity information

### Component Updates:

- `InventoryManagement` - New component for stock management
- `ProductGrid` - Shows stock information and out-of-stock badges
- `ProductInfo` - Displays current stock and prevents purchase of out-of-stock items
- Admin product management now shows quantity

### Key Features:

- ✅ Real-time inventory updates
- ✅ Automatic availability management
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ Product code search
- ✅ Stock level indicators
- ✅ Pagination for large inventories
- ✅ Input validation (no negative quantities)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Toast notifications for success/error states

## Testing Steps:

1. Run the database migration script
2. Go to Admin Dashboard → Inventory
3. Try updating product quantities
4. Verify products disappear from user view when quantity = 0
5. Verify products reappear when quantity > 0
6. Test filtering and search functionality
