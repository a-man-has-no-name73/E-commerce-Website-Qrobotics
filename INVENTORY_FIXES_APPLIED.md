# Inventory Management Fixes Applied

## ✅ Fix 1: Update Button for Quantity Changes

- **Problem**: Database was updating after each digit typed
- **Solution**: Added pending updates state and "Update" button
- **How it works**:
  - User types quantity → stored in `pendingUpdates` state
  - "Update" button appears when there's a pending change
  - Click "Update" → sends API request and updates database
  - Button shows loading spinner during update

## ✅ Fix 2: Product Detail Page Out-of-Stock Issue

- **Problem**: Products showing "Out of Stock" even when available
- **Solution**: Fixed individual product API to use quantity from products table
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `is_available = true` filter from individual product API
  - Updated to use `quantity` field directly from products table
  - Fixed `inStock` calculation to use `product.quantity > 0`
  - Added `quantity` field to product interfaces

## ✅ Fix 3: Show Out-of-Stock Products After In-Stock Products

- **Problem**: Out-of-stock products were completely hidden
- **Solution**: Modified sorting to show available products first, then unavailable
- **Changes**:
  - Removed filter that completely hid out-of-stock products
  - Added ordering by `is_available DESC` (available first)
  - Out-of-stock products now appear after in-stock products
  - Maintains visual indicators (badges, disabled buttons)

## Updated Files:

1. `components/admin/inventory-management.tsx` - Added update button functionality
2. `app/api/products/route.ts` - Modified sorting and filtering
3. `app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed individual product API
4. `components/products/product-info.tsx` - Updated interface
5. `components/products/product-grid.tsx` - Updated interface

## How It Works Now:

### Admin Inventory Management:

1. Type new quantity in input field
2. "Update" button appears
3. Click "Update" to save changes
4. Button shows loading spinner during update
5. Success/error toast notifications

### User Product Viewing:

1. In-stock products appear first (sorted by availability DESC)
2. Out-of-stock products appear after in-stock products
3. Product detail pages show correct stock status
4. Out-of-stock products show "Out of Stock" badge and disabled buttons

### Automatic Stock Management:

- Products with quantity > 0 → automatically available
- Products with quantity = 0 → automatically unavailable
- Database trigger handles this automatically
