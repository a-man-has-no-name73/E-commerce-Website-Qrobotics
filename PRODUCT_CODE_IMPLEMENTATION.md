# Product Code Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added a `product_code` column to the products table and implemented full support across the application.

## Database Changes

### 1. SQL Query to Run

Execute the SQL file: `database/add_product_code_column.sql`

```sql
-- Add product_code column to products table
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN product_code VARCHAR(50);

-- Add unique constraint
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_product_code UNIQUE (product_code);

-- Create index for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_product_code
ON products(product_code);

-- Add comment
COMMENT ON COLUMN products.product_code IS 'Unique product code for identification and display';
```

## Backend Changes

### 1. Updated API Endpoints

#### Create Product API (`app/api/admin/create-product/route.tsx`)

- Added `product_code` to validation schema (optional)
- Updated database insertion to include product_code

#### Edit Product API (`app/api/admin/edit-product/route.ts`)

- Added `product_code` to validation schema (optional)
- Updated product update query to include product_code

### 2. Updated TypeScript Interfaces

#### Database Interface (`lib/db.ts`)

- Added `product_code?: string` to Product interface

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Admin Interface

#### Product Management (`components/admin/product-management.tsx`)

- Added product_code field to both Add and Edit forms
- Updated form state management
- Added product_code display in product list
- Updated payload creation for API calls

**New Form Fields:**

- Add Product: Product Code input field (optional)
- Edit Product: Product Code input field (optional)
- Product List: Shows product code when available

### 2. User Interface

#### Product Display Components

- **Product Info** (`components/products/product-info.tsx`): Shows product code below product name
- **Product Grid** (`components/products/product-grid.tsx`): Shows product code below product name in cards
- **Featured Products** (`components/home/featured-products.tsx`): Shows product code in featured product cards

#### Updated Interfaces

- **use-products hook** (`hooks/use-products.ts`): Added product_code to Product interface
- **ProductInfoProps**: Added product_code to interface

## Features Added

### 1. Admin Features

✅ **Add Product Code** - Optional field when creating products
✅ **Edit Product Code** - Can modify product codes when editing
✅ **Display Product Code** - Shows in admin product list
✅ **Validation** - Unique constraint prevents duplicates

### 2. User Features

✅ **Product Detail Page** - Shows product code below product name
✅ **Product Listing** - Shows product code in product cards
✅ **Featured Products** - Shows product code in homepage featured products
✅ **Responsive Design** - Product code displays properly on all screen sizes

## Design Choices

### 1. Database Design

- **Column Type**: `VARCHAR(50)` - Allows for various code formats
- **Unique Constraint**: Prevents duplicate product codes
- **Optional Field**: Can be NULL to support existing products
- **Indexed**: For fast lookups when searching by product code

### 2. UI/UX Design

- **Admin Forms**: Added as separate field with helpful placeholder text
- **User Display**: Shows in small, monospace font for easy reading
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows when product code exists
- **Consistent Placement**: Always appears below product name

### 3. API Design

- **Optional Field**: Not required for product creation
- **Validation**: Server-side validation with Zod schema
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for validation failures

## Testing Checklist

### Database

- [ ] Run the SQL migration successfully
- [ ] Verify column exists with correct constraints
- [ ] Test unique constraint works

### Admin Interface

- [ ] Create product with product code
- [ ] Create product without product code
- [ ] Edit existing product to add product code
- [ ] Edit existing product to modify product code
- [ ] Verify product code appears in admin product list

### User Interface

- [ ] View product with product code on detail page
- [ ] View product without product code on detail page
- [ ] Check product code appears in product grid
- [ ] Check product code appears in featured products
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile

### API Testing

- [ ] Test POST /api/admin/create-product with product_code
- [ ] Test POST /api/admin/create-product without product_code
- [ ] Test PUT /api/admin/edit-product with product_code
- [ ] Test validation for duplicate product codes

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Product with Code

```typescript
const productData = {
  name: "Arduino Uno R3",
  price: 2500,
  product_code: "ARD-UNO-R3",
  description: "Microcontroller board",
  category_id: 1,
};
```

### Displaying Product Code

The product code will automatically appear:

- In admin product management
- On product detail pages
- In product cards/grids
- In featured products section

## Notes

- Product codes are optional and backwards compatible
- Unique constraint ensures no duplicates
- Monospace font used for better readability
- Conditional rendering prevents empty displays
- All existing products will have NULL product_code (which is fine)
